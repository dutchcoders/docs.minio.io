# Minio Python Quick Start

 
##1. Install
<!-- Rushan : All code blocks must be copyable and pasteable. Please use black screens for code blocks like prism.js (twilight) does? -->

#### Install with pip
    
	$ pip install minio		 

##2. Example

	from minio import Minio

	# Instantiate a client
	minoClient = Minio('play.minio.io:9000',
	                access_key='Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F',
	                secret_key='zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG')

	# List buckets
	buckets = minioClient.list_buckets()
	for bucket in buckets:
	    print('bucket:', bucket.name, bucket.creation_date)
